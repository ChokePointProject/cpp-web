		<h1>About</h1>

		We've added data to a branch of the ChokepointProject based on two
		data sources:
		<ol>
			<li>Broadband statistics provided by Measurement Lab (M-Lab) and</li>
			<li>theTransparency Reports published by Google.</li>
		</ol>
		The former contains continuous information about the Internet speed at
		various locations in the world. By analyzing this data,
		ChokepointProject automatically estimates the Internet connectivity for
		almost every country and city.
