<strong>What we did:</strong>
</p>
<p>
We built this test version of a planned larger platform using broadband statistics provided by <a href="http://www.measurementlab.net/" class="data-source" target="_blank">Measurement Lab (M-Lab)</a>and the <a href="http://www.google.com/transparencyreport/" class="data-source" target="_blank">Transparency Reports </a>published by Google. The former contains continuous information about the Internet speed at various locations in the world. By analyzing this data, we can estimate the Internet connectivity status for the countries and cities covered by the data.
</p>
<p>
Our main aim has been working to build a platform to give people a tool to know what's happening in their country now and over the historical period, augmented with information on law and lobbying activities. We created a branch of our application for the hackathon and this is the result of 1,5 days work.

<p>
<strong>Some use of dummy data:</strong>
</p>
<p>
The landing page of this example app is displaying dummy data for the current incidents listed under the map. It's there to give you an idea of what this application could become. Obviously getting radar jamming data is a completely different from monitoring internet traffic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>We need more data:</strong>
</p>
<p>
If you know of relevant data sets either historical or dynamic that you think would benefit this project, please <a href="http://www.chokepointproject.net" class="data-source">let us know</a>.
